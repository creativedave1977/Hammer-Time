            Your objectives are to create a .Net web application which interfaces with a SQL server database backend. Requirements for this project are that
            there must be an interface to view all hammers as well as an interface to make changes to the on-hand inventory of hammers including but not
            limited to creation of new types of hammers and edits to existing hammers.
            Please develop a Visual Studio solution/project that meets the objective. Please include all relevant code files for your project including SQL
